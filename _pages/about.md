Hi! I'm a robotics engineer with a deep curiosity for how machines perceive, learn, and act in the real world. My journey began with hands-on experimentation and quickly evolved into focused research during my thesis, where I collaborated with imec to explore practical applications of AI in robotics.

I thrive at the intersection of intelligent software and mechanical systems where algorithms leave the screen and meet reality. I’m especially drawn to challenges in computer vision, motion planning, and real-time decision-making for autonomous systems.

Beyond the technical side, I’m driven by the idea of building useful, meaningful systems tools that extend human capability, improve industry, or push what robots can do. I'm always learning, always building, and currently looking for opportunities to join teams that turn bold ideas into working machines.
